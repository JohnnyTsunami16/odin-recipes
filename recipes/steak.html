Busting conventional steak-cooking wisdom makes for better steak.When you really want a straight-forward, no-fuss steak with a crisp crust and juicy center, I can say without question that the most fail-proof way to cook it on the stovetop only requires three steps. Partnered with a few essential tips, this simple three-step method will give you a perfectly cooked stovetop steak with a tender buttery flavor, cooked just the way you like it, every time.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Ribeye or New York steaks</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>2 to 3 sprigs of fresh thyme or rosemary</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the steaks - </strong>Remove the steaks from the refrigerator about 30 minutes to 1 hour before cooking. Place them on a paper towel-lined plate and pat dry with more paper towels. This will help dry the surface of the meat, making a better crust.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the rest of the ingredients - </strong>Because cooking the steaks will go quickly with almost no hands-off cooking time, make sure you have the rest of the ingredients handy, as well as a probe thermometer and a clean plate for resting the steaks.</li>
        <li><strong>Season the steaks - </strong>Just before cooking, liberally coat the steaks with the salt, making sure to coat the sides of the steaks as well.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat the pan - </strong>Heat a 12-inch cast iron skillet over high heat for about 10 minutes; the pan should smoke just a bit when it is properly heated.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the steaks - </strong>Carefully place the steaks in the hot pan and cook on the first side until enough of a crust has developed that the steaks no longer stick to the pan, about 1 minute. Flip and cook on the other side for 1 minute. Continue cooking and flipping for a total of 4 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Flavor and baste the steaks - </strong>Carefully add the butter, garlic, and herbs to the pan. Flip the steaks once more. Tilt the pan so the butter pools on one side and use a large spoon to baste the butter over the steaks. Flip again and repeat. Begin checking the internal temperature of the steaks at 6 minutes total cook time for your preferred doneness. Medium rare is between 125°F and 130°F.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest the steaks(optional) - </strong>Transfer the steaks to the plate to rest for 5 minutes. While the steaks rest, prepare a pan sauce if desired.</li>
        <li><strong>Carve the steaks - </strong>Transfer the steaks to a cutting board and thinly slice across the grain. Serve immediately with the pan juices or pan sauce.</li>
