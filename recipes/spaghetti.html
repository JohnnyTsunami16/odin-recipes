    <h2>Spaghetti ala Puttanesca</h2>
    <p>Spaghetti alla Puttanesca is a traditional Italian pasta from Naples that’s quick to put together from pantry staples. If you have canned tomatoes, garlic, olives, anchovies and capers in your cupboard, you can knock out this simple but flavourful sauce in a flash. It’s a stellar emergency meal everyone should know, with a “saucy” backstory of its own!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Black Olives</li>
        <li>Anchovies</li>
        <li>Spaghetti</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Capers</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Chilli Flakes</li>
        <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Fresh Basil and Oregano</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Saute aromaticss - </strong>Start off by sautéing the garlic in olive oil until it starts to go golden on the edges. Then add the finely chopped anchovies, capers, olives and red pepper flakes and cook for a further 1 minute.

            This sautéing step is key to the flavour of the sauce. It blooms the flavour of the red pepper flakes and even more importantly, takes the raw fishy edge off the anchovies while causing them to break down, ready to dissolve into the sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Add everything else into the sauce - </strong>Add the can of tomatoes, then add water by rinsing out the can. In goes salt, pepper and fresh or dried oregano, then give it a good stir.</li>
        <li><strong>Simmer 10 minutes - </strong>Once the sauce comes to a simmer, turn the heat way down to low and let it simmer gently, stirring every now and then, for 10 minutes while the pasta cooks. The tomato will break down, the water will cook out, leaving behind a nice, shiny and thickened sauce.

            If at any stage it looks like the sauce is drying out (probably due to heat being too strong or using a skillet that’s too large), just add a splash of water.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook pasta</strong>Cook the pasta in salted water. Just before draining, scoop out a mugful of pasta cooking water. This is a key, essential step for cooking any pasta (well and properly!). We add a splash into the pasta sauce when tossing with the pasta. Starch that’s left in the cooking water helps emulsify the fats and water in the sauce. This has a thickening effect and also discourages the sauce from separating. The sauce clings deliciously to the pasta strands instead of leaving a watery pool of bland liquid at the bottom of your pasta bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine pasta, sauce and pasta cooking water - </strong>After draining the pasta, immediately throw into the sauce along with about 1/4 cup of pasta cooking water. I rarely measure, I just eyeball it.</li>
        <li><strong>Toss, toss, toss! - </strong>With the skillet still on a low stove, use 2 wooden spoons to toss the pasta vigorously for a minute. After 20 or 30 seconds of tossing, you’ll notice that the sauce in the skillet starts clinging to the pasta (thanks to the pasta cooking water!).

            The pasta is ready when the sauce is all stuck to the pasta rather than sitting in the skillet.</li>
        <li><strong>Pasta/sauce gets dry - </strong>If at any stage the pasta (or sauce) gets too thick or dries out, rather than being slippery and shiny, just add an extra splash of pasta cooking water then toss more. This will resurrect the pasta and makes it “juicy” again. This is why we scoop out a big mugful of pasta cooking water! I do this multiple times when taking photos and shooting videos of pasta because it loses freshness within minutes and I can’t shoot that fast!</li>
        <li><strong>Sprinkle with basil - </strong>Serve immediately!</li>            
    </ol>
